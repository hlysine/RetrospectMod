  "description": "The Retrospect is a custom Slay The Spire character with brand-new mechanics that require you to think ahead and calculate your moves. You often have to fight with low effective HP and pay extra attention to the playing order of your cards. Even playing Strike and Defend in different order can make a huge difference. In return, you get the ability to evade card costs and manipulate cards like no other characters. Nothing is more satisfying than decimating your enemies with a pile of cards you spent no energy on.",
